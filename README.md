Just use the renderer syntax: `{{renderer random-block, [[xxx]]|((yyy))|#zzz, [size=1], [extra='']` or use the slash command: `Random Block`

### parameters

- page|block|tag, it is recognized by prefix, `[[` or `((` or `#`
- size, how many blocks you want to retrieve, size is 1 by default.
- extra content will append to the random block. I use this to give block specific styles.
